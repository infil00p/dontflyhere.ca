Don't Fly Here is an example application that is created partly so that I could figure out where to fly,
and partly so that I can test out Google Play Store features with a real application.  This application was created
because I needed to figure out where I could legally fly, and is definitely not complete.  It's not intended
to be used as a solid compendium, or a replacement for NAV Canada Navigation charts, or to be used for Navigation
at all.  I highly recommend checking other applications which have actual dedicated developers instead of this
hobby project I use for testing PhoneGap App Publishing.

In short, if you are not sure you should be flying your drone in a location, don't fly your drone, and check with 
Transport Canada.  We take no responsiblity for incomplete data, since we know this is far from complete and is intended
as a general guide only.
